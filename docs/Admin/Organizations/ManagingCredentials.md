#  Manage Credentials 

In {{ MyVariables.ProductName_Overlord }}, you need to set up credentials while adding the sources for crawling your data. You can then review the credentials, edit, or delete them on the Configuration &gt; Managed Organizations &gt; Credentials tab, by selecting the organization.

This page allows to you review you the name of the source you created, its location (cloud or on-prem), and type. You can edit or delete the credential by selecting the credential and then click the **Edit** or **Delete** icon.
