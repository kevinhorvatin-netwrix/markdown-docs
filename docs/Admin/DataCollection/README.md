# Data Collection

The {{ MyVariables.ProductName_Overlord }} data collection workflow is as follows:

Add organizations. See the [Add Organizations](../Organizations/AddOrganizations.md)  topic for additional information.

Install the agent. See the [Install Agent](../../Install/InstallAgent.md) topic for additional information. 

Once you have added the organization and selected the domain for collecting the data, {{ MyVariables.ProductName_Overlord }} starts collecting audit data from the managed Active Directory, Azure AD domain, a computer, an Exchange Online, or a SharePoint Online collection.
