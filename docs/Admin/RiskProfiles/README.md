# Introducing Risk Profiles

In {{ MyVariables.ProductName_Overlord }}, a Risk Profile examines the nature and level of threats faced within an organization. Generally, the Managed Service Provider (MSP) can add and configure its own profile and then investigate the security risks. Such risks include inactive user accounts, disabled computer accounts, or empty security groups. MSPs can then review the Risk Assessment Dashboard to find out the risks within their organization.
