# Configure IT Infrastructure for Auditing and Monitoring

{{ MyVariables.ProductName_Overlord }} relies on native logs for collecting audit data. Therefore, successful change and access auditing requires a certain configuration of native audit settings in the audited environment and on the computer where Netwrix Cloud Agent resides. Configuring your IT infrastructure may also include enabling certain built-in Windows services, etc. Proper audit configuration is required to ensure audit data integrity, otherwise your change reports may contain warnings, errors or incomplete audit data.

You can configure your IT Infrastructure for monitoring in one of the following ways:

- Automatically when creating a monitoring plan. This is a recommended method.
- Manually.
