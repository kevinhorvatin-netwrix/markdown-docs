Netwrix 1Secure 2024.12.13 New Alerts and Permission Reports for SharePoint Online We have introduced four new state-in-time reports and six alerts to help users detect risky permission configurations in SharePoint Online. These new reports and alerts enhance visibility and provide actionable insights to maintain a secure SharePoint environment. Alerts External User Activity \u2013 Keeps track of all actions performed by guest users. Sharing with Anyone Enabled on Site \u2013 Helps manage and audit when and how SharePoint sites are made accessible to users outside the organization. New Sharing Link with External User Access \u2013 Reports the creation of new sharing links that grant access to external users. Helps control how content is being shared externally, ensuring that external access is granted appropriately. Anonymous Sharing Link Created \u2013 Monitors anonymous access to ensure that only authorized users can view and interact with the content. High-Risk Permissions Added \u2013 Helps oversee and mitigate potential security risks by ensuring that elevated permissions are granted with proper justification. High-Risk Members Added \u2013 Helps to ensure that membership changes involving broad or sensitive groups are properly monitored and controlled. Reports Direct User Permissions \u2013 Displays user accounts with direct permissions to specific objects, such as documents, lists, or sites. You can filter the list by object types, account status (enabled or disabled), last logon time, or if it\u2019s a guest account. Broken Permissions Inheritance \u2013 Lists objects with permissions different from their parent, for example, when a folder has different permissions than the site it\u2019s located in, which makes it harder to keep permissions manageable. High-Risk Permissions \u2013 Shows the permissions of Authenticated users, Anonymous logon, or domain users, including the object URL, resource type, and permission level. Direct Object Permissions \u2013 Displays all identities (users or groups) that have assigned permissions to specific objects, such as documents, lists, or sites. New Alerts and Reports for {{ no such element: dict object['Azure_AD_app'] }} Thirteen new alerts and ten new activity reports are now available for {{ no such element: dict object['Azure_AD_app'] }} to assist in threat detection. Seven reports and seven alerts (based on these new reports) are completely new. Six of the thirteen alerts and three of the ten reports, previously available for Active Directory, now also cover {{ no such element: dict object['Azure_AD_app'] }} activities, helping users better detect and respond to potential threats. New {{ no such element: dict object['Azure_AD_app'] }} alerts and reports {{ no such element: dict object['Azure_AD_app'] }} Role Management Permission Grant \u2013 Identifies when the Microsoft Graph RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory (Delegated or Application) permission is granted to a service principal. An adversary could use this permission to add a {{ no such element: dict object['Azure_AD_app'] }} object to an Admin directory role and escalate privileges. Mail.Read Permissions Granted to Application \u2013 Detects applications that have been granted permissions to read mail in all mailboxes without a signed-in user. This can help identify applications that have been abused to gain access to mailboxes. MFA Rejected by User \u2013 Identifies occurrences where a user has rejected an MFA prompt. This could be an indicator that a threat actor has compromised the username and password of this user account and is using them to try and log into the account. (Multiple) User Removed from a Privileged Role \u2013 Detects when one or more existing admins are removed, which can be an attempt by adversaries to lock down the organization and retain sole access. (Multiple) {{ no such element: dict object['Azure_AD_app'] }} Admin Permissions Granted \u2013 Identifies when one or more users' permissions are changed at once. User Added to a {{ no such element: dict object['Azure_AD_app'] }} Privileged Group \u2013 Tracks when a user is added to any of the Privileged Groups. User Assigned New Privileged Role \u2013 Identifies when a new eligible or active privileged role is assigned to a user. Alerts (previously available for Active Directory) Account Deleted \u2013 Alerts when a user, computer, or account is deleted. Account Disabled \u2013 Alerts when a user, computer, or account is disabled. Account Enabled \u2013 Alerts when a user, computer, or account is enabled. Account Locked Out \u2013 Alerts when a user account is locked out due to multiple incorrect password inputs. Account with Password Tampered \u2013 Alerts on changes to the \"Password never expires\" setting. Multiple Failed Logons \u2013 Alerts when a user account fails to log on multiple times in a short time frame. Reports (previously available for Active Directory) All Logon Activity \u2013 Helps validate compliance and analyze user activity by showing all {{ no such element: dict object['Azure_AD_app'] }} logon activities. Failed Logons \u2013 Shows failed logon attempts. User Account Status Changes \u2013 Shows changes to the status (enabled, disabled, locked, or unlocked) of user accounts. New Data Source: SQL Server Logon Reporting SQL Server is now available as a new data source in Netwrix 1Secure, enhancing database visibility and security monitoring. The initial two reports allow users to review both successful and failed logon attempts to their SQL databases: All SQL Logons \u2013 Logs all SQL logon attempts, providing insights into who is accessing the database and when. SQL Failed Logons \u2013 Logs failed logon attempts, helping users detect potential security threats and unauthorized access attempts. Risk Mapping with MITRE ATT&CK Matrix for Enterprise All risks in the Netwrix 1Secure risk assessment dashboard are now categorized based on the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK) framework. This categorization helps users understand risks in the context of the cyberattack lifecycle and prioritize responses accordingly, improving their overall security posture. Major Enhancements Numerous additional enhancements have been made to improve administration, performance, and security. Netwrix 1Secure 2024.09.12 New: {{ no such element: dict object['Azure_AD_app'] }} Reports Two new reports provide visibility into roles and role members within your {{ no such element: dict object['Azure_AD_app'] }} organization.

See the Filters topic for additional information. New: Risk Assessment 2.0 The completely redesigned Risk Assessment not only helps clients and MSPs diagnose their security posture better than ever, but also identifies many new risk factors. Users can subscribe to the report and export it as a .pptx file. Furthermore, {{ no such element: dict object['Azure_AD_app'] }} data is incorporated into the assessed risks. The list of new risks includes: User Accounts with \"No MFA Configured\" Stale Guest Accounts User Accounts Created via Email Verified Self-Service Creation Found Dangerous Default Permissions Third-Party Applications Allowed Unified Audit Log Search is Not Enabled MS Graph Powershell Service Principal Assignment Not Enforced MS Graph Powershell Service Principal Configuration Missing Expired Domain Registration Found Self-Service Password Reset is Not Enabled Improper Number of Global Administrators See the Review Risks using Risks Assessment Dashboard topic for additional information.

See the table below, whether the risk is binary You can also search the risks by typing a keyword in the Filter by keyword field. The following table provides a list of risks and descriptions. Risk Name Description User accounts with \"Password never expires\" (Enumerated) Enabled user accounts whose passwords never expire might be in violation of your organization's security policy. User accounts with \"Password not required\" (Enumerated) Accounts that can be used to log on without a password are a high risk and require immediate attention. Disabled computer accounts (Enumerated) Disabled computers often lack current patches and antivirus software, making them easy targets for cyberattacks if they are re-enabled. Periodically identifying and deleting these accounts will reduce this risk. Inactive user accounts (Enumerated) Inactive user accounts can be taken over and misused, so you should periodically identify and disable them, and then remove them. Inactive computer accounts (Enumerated) Inactive computer accounts can be misused, so you should periodically identify and disable them, and then remove them. User accounts with administrative permissions (Enumerated) Minimizing the number of users with administrative privileges reduces security risks and is required by many compliance mandates. Administrative groups (Enumerated) Minimizing the number of administrative groups helps you understand and control the assignment of powerful permissions, as required for security and compliance. Empty security groups (Enumerated) Empty security groups with administrative privileges are a potential back door for attackers. Regularly identify and delete empty groups. Stale Guest Accounts (Enumerated) Any guest users that have not logged in for \"X\" days. By default, the accounts that have not logged in for 35 days are shown. You can filter this data. User Accounts Created via Email Verified Self-Service Creation (Enumerated) User accounts created with self-service account creation. Self-service account creation when not strictly verified, can allow unauthorized individuals to gain access to an organization's systems. This can lead to unauthorized data access, leakage of sensitive information, and the establishment of footholds for further attacks within the network. User accounts with \"No MFA Configured\" (Enumerated) User accounts which MFA is not configured with the admins of the organizations in {{ no such element: dict object['Azure_AD_app'] }}. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead directly to unauthorized entry, bypassing what is now considered a basic security standard. In the absence of MFA, even a strong password policy may not be sufficient to protect against phishing attacks and credential stuffing, which can lead to data breaches and system compromises. Improper Number of Global Administrators (Binary) Maintain strict control over the number of global administrators to minimize the risk of internal and external threats. Elevated privileges associated with such roles can lead to significant breaches if misused or compromised, disrupting business operations and potentially leading to substantial data loss or compliance violations. Self-Serve Password Reset is Not Enabled (Binary) Office 365's Self-Serve Password Reset feature enables users to reset their own password. It is recommended to allow users to reset their own passwords for the purpose of recovering their account in the event of accidental lockout or a security incident. Unified Audit Log Search is Not Enabled (Binary) Unified Audit Log Search allows for the centralized ingestion and searching of audit logs generated by Office 365 and can be a vital source of data for the investigation and detection of security incidents. It is recommended to enable unified audit log searching. Conditional Access Policies (Binary) Insufficient Conditional Access and Security Defaults Configuration: The absence of Conditional Access policies coupled with disabled Microsoft Security Defaults creates a significant security vulnerability. This condition exposes the tenant to a variety of attacks due to inadequate protective measures. It is required for the organization to either enable Microsoft Security Defaults for common security features or establish fine-grained Conditional Access policies tailored to the organization\u2019s specific security needs. Ensuring these security configurations are active and correctly set up is crucial to safeguard the tenant environment and user accounts from potential cyber threats. Conditional Access Policy Disables Admin Token Persistence (Binary) Looks for Conditional Access policies that disable token persistence for users with admin roles and have a sign-in frequency that is less than or equal to nine hours. When an admin login has their token cached on the client, they are vulnerable for a Primary Refresh Token related attack. Dangerous Default Permissions (Binary) By default, Azure tenants allow all users to access the {{ no such element: dict object['Azure_AD_app'] }} blade, to read all other users\u2019 accounts, create groups, and invite guests. These default settings extend to guest accounts as well, allowing guests to perform these same actions. Other default configurations allow for Self-Service creation of accounts from accepted mail domains. Amend dangerous default permissions, mitigating the risk of unauthorized data access and ensuring that only the necessary personnel have the appropriate level of access to sensitive systems and information. Expired Domain Registrations Found (Binary) Expired domains can be used for any attack vector that exploits an organization\u2019s identity, such as account takeovers or phishing campaigns. Monitoring domain registration for the organization can help detect and alert on attempts to exploit this attack path. MS Graph Powershell Service Principal Assignment Not Enforced (Binary) Checks if the assignment for MsGraph Powershell is required. By default, Azure tenants allow all users to access Microsoft Graph PowerShell Module. This allows any authenticated user or guest the ability to abuse Dangerous Default Permissions, as well as enumerate the entire tenant. Third-Party Applications Allowed (Binary) Third-party integrated applications are allowed to run in the organization's Office 365 environment if you authorize them to do so. This configuration is considered insecure because a user may grant permissions to a malicious application without fully understanding the security implications. A user who installs a malicious third-party application is in effect compromised. Additionally, there are documented cases of a malicious actor gaining access to sensitive information by enticing a user to allow a third-party integrated application to run within their O365 Tenant.

Open the Group Policy Management console on any domain controller in the target domain: navigate to Start > Windows Administrative Tools (Windows Server 2016 and higher) or Administrative Tools (Windows 2012) > Group Policy Management. In the left pane, navigate to Forest: <forest_name> > Domains > <domain_name> > Domain Controllers . Right-click the effective domain controllers policy (by default, it is the Default Domain Controllers Policy ), and select Edit from the pop-up menu. Navigate to Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Event Log and double-click the Maximum security log size policy. In the Maximum security log size Properties dialog, select Define this policy setting and set maximum security log size to \"4194240\" kilobytes (4GB). Select the Retention method for security log policy. In the Retention method for security log Properties dialog, check Define this policy and select Overwrite events as needed . Navigate to Start > Run and type \"cmd\" . Input the gpupdate /force command and press Enter . The group policy will be updated. If \"Overwrite\" option is not enough to meet your data retention requirements, you can use auto-archiving option for Security event log to preserve historical event data in the archive files. With that option enabled, you may want to adjust the retention settings for log archives (backups).

Check requirements Make sure the Windows File Servers you want to monitor meet the requirements listed in the Prerequisites for Data Sources section. Decide on audit data to collect Review the list of objects and attributes that can be monitored by Netwrix 1Secure: . Plan for the file servers and shares you want to audit. Consider the following: If you have multiple file shares frequently accessed by a significant number of users, it is reasonable to audit object changes only. Tracking all events may result in too much data written to the audit logs, whereas only some part of it may be of any interest. Audit flags must be set on every file share or the whole computer you want to audit. If your file shares are stored within one folder (or disk drive), you can configure audit settings for this folder only. As a result, you will receive reports on all required access types applied to all file shares within this folder. It is not recommended to configure audit settings for system disks. - By default, Netwrix 1Secure will monitor all shares stored in the specified location, except for hidden shares (both default and user-defined). If you want to monitor user-defined hidden shares, select the related option in the monitored item settings. Administrative hidden shares like default system root or Windows directory ( ADMIN$ ), default drive shares ( D$, E$ ), etc. will not be monitored. Review considerations and limitations The following considerations and limitations refer to data collection: To collect data from 32-bit operating systems, network traffic compression must be disabled. To collect data from Windows Failover Cluster, network traffic compression must be enabled. Scale-Out File Server (SOFS) cluster is not supported. The following considerations and limitations refer to reporting: For Windows File Servers running Windows Server 2008, changes to the file shares will be reported without exact initiator's account in the who field\u2014 instead, system is reported. If a file server is running Windows Server 2008 SP2, Netwrix 1Secure may be unable to retrieve workstation name for the failed read attempts. In the reports and search results, in some cases, Netwrix 1Secure UI displays not the actual time when the event occurred but data collection time. Netwrix 1Secure may report on several unexpected changes with who (initiator's account) reported as system due to the native Windows File Servers audit peculiarities. If you do not want to see these changes, exclude them from the audit. See for more information. For example - mass file removals, when target Windows server generates too many events at a time and the product is unable to parse their sequences correctly. Due to Windows limitations, the copy/rename/move actions on remote file shares may be reported as two sequential actions: copying \u2013 as adding a new file and reading the initial file; renaming/moving \u2013 as removing the initial file and adding a new file with the same name. To report on copy actions on remote file shares, make sure that audit of successful read operations is enabled. See for details. Apply required audit settings Depending on your auditing requirements, you may need to audit your file server objects for: Successful read, added, modified, removed, renamed, moved, copied attempts; Failed read, added, modified, removed, renamed, moved, copied attempts; For that, object-level audit settings and appropriate audit policies should be set up. Besides, the following should be configured for your Windows file servers: Windows Event log size and retention settings Remote registry service Inbound connection rules for Windows firewall You can apply the required audit settings to your Windows file servers in one of the following ways: Automatically - The current audit settings will be applied automatically.

This app enables secure access to the Netwrix 1Secure cloud-based infrastructure via Microsoft Graph and other modern APIs. You have to configure the app in {{ no such element: dict object['Azure_AD_app'] }} once, as it can be used to audit multiple Microsoft 365 data sources, including SharePoint Online, {{ no such element: dict object['Azure_AD_app'] }}, and Exchange Online. It is recommended to register a dedicated app in {{ no such element: dict object['Azure_AD_app'] }} for each data source that you want to audit in Netwrix 1Secure. While sharing a single app across multiple data sources is allowed, it may lead to issues such as throttling. For example, if there are too many connections to Microsoft Graph, some connections may be temporarily stopped. Additionally, different data sources may require different permissions and you might not grant all permissions to a single app. To begin auditing Microsoft 365 data sources, manually register the app for Netwrix 1Secure in {{ no such element: dict object['Azure_AD_app'] }} and provide its settings while adding a data source in Netwrix 1Secure. A user account with the Global Administrator, Application Administrator, or Cloud Application Administrator role is required to grant admin consent for certain permissions to the registered application.

This app enables secure access to the Netwrix 1Secure cloud-based infrastructure via Microsoft Graph and other modern APIs. You have to configure the app in {{ no such element: dict object['Azure_AD_app'] }} once, as it can be used to audit multiple Microsoft 365 data sources, including SharePoint Online, {{ no such element: dict object['Azure_AD_app'] }}, and Exchange Online. It is recommended to register a dedicated app in {{ no such element: dict object['Azure_AD_app'] }} for each data source that you want to audit in Netwrix 1Secure. While sharing a single app across multiple data sources is allowed, it may lead to issues such as throttling. For example, if there are too many connections to Microsoft Graph, some connections may be temporarily stopped. Additionally, different data sources may require different permissions and you might not grant all permissions to a single app. To begin auditing Microsoft 365 data sources, manually register the app for Netwrix 1Secure in {{ no such element: dict object['Azure_AD_app'] }} and provide its settings while adding a data source in Netwrix 1Secure. A user account with the Global Administrator, Application Administrator, or Cloud Application Administrator role is required to grant admin consent for certain permissions to the registered application.
